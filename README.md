## What is this?
Picture this: you're chatting with your friends, when all of a sudden, you've thought of the perfect meme for the occasion! Quickly, you search your downloads folder, only to realize that you've forgotten the filename! (or worse, that the meme is on your other computer!)

memeity aims to fix this issue by hosting all of your memes on Google Drive - syncing to all of your devices. It also boasts a wide variety of features in order to make finding the perfect one easier.

## Features
- **Filename and OCR search**:  find your memes however you remember them - or however you don't.
- **Tags**: color-coded tags that sync everywhere. Select a bunch of memes and tag them at once, then search with `#tag`.
- **Easy setup with Google Drive**: just log into memeity with Google Drive for a near-instant setup. For your privacy, memeity only sees the files it creates itself and uses only a single folder.
- **Quickly add memes**: drag and drop, or paste your memes into the pane to instantly process new images!
- **Quick & powerful built-in editor**: edit and markup your memes & templates in an instant, right inside the memeity pane.
- **Automatic updates**: memeity handles all of its own updates, so you'll never have to worry about keeping up to date again.
- **Cross-platform**: memeity is supported on Windows, macOS and Linux, with plans to expand to a web-based client!
- **No telemetry**: memeity never phones home - I don't need your data, silly!

## Installation
Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/purestellenium/memeity/releases/latest) for your platform, and install normally following the wizard / DMG file.

On Linux, download the `.AppImage`, make it executable (`chmod +x memeity_*.AppImage`) and run it. It needs a 2024-or-newer distro (glibc 2.38+, e.g. Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 39, Debian 13) and a Secret Service keyring (GNOME Keyring or KWallet) to keep you signed in. The shortcut, Paste to App and pane placement need X11; on Wayland, bind a desktop shortcut to the AppImage instead: launching it again opens the pane.

## AI Declaration
I used AI heavily (Claude Opus 5.5) in the development of memeity- I just wanted something that worked, and so using AI was the quickest way to make this happen.
The development process of this app was heavily supervised by me to ensure high code quality, but Rust is not a language I consider myself proficient in.
